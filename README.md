### My Process
- Design the Desktop Viewport WHILE desinging the Mobile viewport at the same time using LESS CSS Preprocessor
- Design the flex/grid system, making sure to have both Desktop and Mobile Viewport layout correct
- Add in all the other HTML content
- Finished up all the CSS designs
- Create the mobile menu and make it toggle, open and closing it via JS

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- LESS CSS Preprocessor

### What I Learned
- More Flexbox, Flex-wrap
- More LESS CSS Preprocessor
- **Always** use vh/vw as a starting point, then %width and %height then use rem units on smaller things
- **Always** use padding FIRST inside big sections before the putting in the flexboxes
- **DO NOT** manually position elements inside big sections
- Add padding **FIRST!** before flexing the items
